# Kryptopixel-marketplace üñºüí≤
## Principle
* A user puts an item for sale, the ownership of the item will be transferred from the creator to the marketplace.
* A user purchases an item, the purchase price will be transferred from the buyer to the seller and the item will be transferred from the marketplace to the buyer.
* The marketplace owner will be able to set a listing fee. This fee will be taken from the seller and transferred to the contract owner upon completion of any sale, enabling the owner of the marketplace to earn recurring revenue from any sale transacted in the marketplace.

### The marketplace logic will consist of two smart contracts
* <strong>NFT Contract</strong> - This contract allows users to mint unique digital assets.
* <strong>Marketplace Contract</strong> - This contract allows users to put their digital assets for sale on an open market.
